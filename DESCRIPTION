Description: Time-Domain Heart Rate Variability Analysis is one way to analyze and 		
  interpret heart rate data. Time domain indices quantify the amount of variance in 	
  the inter-beat-intervals (IBI). It is frequently used across different domains of
	research, such as medicine, human kinetics, and psychology. Benefits of this 		
	method	is that the cost of collecting this type of data is relatively low 		
	compared to other methods and statistical outputs can be compared across 		
	individuals. This package includes a function to organize the data input, and 		
	subsequent functions to calculate Time-Domain statistical values. Each value is a 	
	different way of quantifying the HRV data.
